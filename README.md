Design & evaluation of an automated material handling system for a post-processing line.  
Focused on **conveyors, diverters, buffers, sensors/cameras, and KPI-driven simulation**.  
Target: **90 bars/hour throughput** with improved reliability.

## ‚≠ê Project Summary (STAR)

**A) Situation**  
Post-processing line required higher throughput but suffered from bottlenecks at critical stations.  

**B) Task**  
Design an automated material handling system with conveyors, diverters, and sensors that ensures ~90 bars/hour without overloading machines.  

**C) Action**  
- Modeled multiple alternative layouts and simulated performance.  
- Selected conveyors, diverters, and accumulators; integrated sensors & camera checks.  
- Evaluated throughput, utilization, and waiting elements; optimized buffer sizes.  

**D) Result**  
- Achieved **90 bars/hour** throughput.  
- Reduced machine overload by balancing utilization.  
- Delivered a scalable, reliable automation concept for manufacturing.
